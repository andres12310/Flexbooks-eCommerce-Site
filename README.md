# Flexbooks-eCommerce-Site

This project is a fake eCommerce Website that I created for a school project alongside a group of 4 students. This website allows you to browse through books that are already stored in our database and purchase them. There is no real purchase however, it only gives the illusions to the user that he did in fact place an order. 

There are 3 versions to this website. 

This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Ajax, Java Servlet, MySQL, JSP, and REST. There are 3 versions to this project. 

The first version uses PHP for the backend. The second version uses Java Servlets for the backend. The third servlet uses Java servlets as well but the servlets make requests to the REST services that I implemented using the Jersey Framework.
